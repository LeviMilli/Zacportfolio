											<h3 class="major">Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda : The Love Letters of F.Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald</h3>
											<p>While F. Scot Fitzgerald should be on everyone’s reading list probably at least once a year, there are many misconceptions and rumors surrounding the relationship between him and his wife. While I’m sure that they had their problems, and those are well documented, this book is a look at the actual relationship betwen them. The fondness that they hold for each other, even while individually falling apart is a stark reminder why Fitzgerald though that “love, only love, could heal our brokenness.”</p>

											<h3 class="major">Oscar Wilde, Complete Collection</h3>
											<p>During Pride Month, I started to work through the works of Oscar Wilde. I couldn’t have been happier to really dive into this man’s work and soon bought the collected works. If you want to take your writing seriously in the modern world Oscar Wilde is a must read. From poetry to plays Oscar Wilde presents his cutting whit in a manner that so seemlessly blends with the story that reading the story because a part of knowing Mr. Wilde. A style that anyone could learn from.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace</h3>
											<p>If you’ve never read the actual writings of David Foster Wallace his short essays and short stories are a much easier place to start than the massive TOMES of work that are his novels. If you have read anything from DFW then this is a great way to get a real look at the man behind the words. David often poured himself into his work and it felt like knowing him to read him but this is a wonderful inside perspect to a man who often cast a persona that felt much larger than life itself.</p>

											<h3 class="major">The Chronicles of Narnia Box Set: Full-Color Collector's Edition</h3>
											<p>C.S. Lewis is classic, very literally. In the fantasy space there are few stories as iconic as the Chronicals of Narnia. Portal fiction is something that fantasy will never get away from. When done right it can put a world of infinite possibilities just left of our reality. This is the magic of portal fiction. It could work that way, and there really isn’t much you can say to counter that. Beyond that the world of Narnia is a wonder that anyone who wants to write fiction can always learn from. The style, and prose is smooth and Lewis has a pithy dialog that comes across and punchy and immenent.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/image-edited.jpg" alt="" /></span>The journey to becoming a “writer” is not always so straightforward; It can be tumultuous even. Zac started out writing little stories with little to know direction when he was in his late teens. It was always easier for him to turn in a creative writing essay for class than any other kind, and he often did just that, earning a much lower grade, but enjoying the assignment enough to make it worht it. Since then he’s had a life that always seems to be in competition with his desire to write. Not till recently did he beging to take the act of writing seriously. In 2016 he started going to college for English, but it wasn’t until the pandemic or 2020 that he decided it was time to really sit down and start to work on making books a reality in the world. This website is part of his journey. He hopes to share lessons and stories he learns and finds along the way. Hopefull you all enjoy this process too, because he certainly is!</p>
